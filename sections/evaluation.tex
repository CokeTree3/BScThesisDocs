\section{Evaluation}\label{s:evaluation}

Discuss the design of your experiments, the results you obtained, and how they
help in evaluating the claims you made in the introduction. You may also use the
evaluation results in this section to justify your design choices or assess the
contributions of different aspects  of your design towards the overall goals.

\subsection{Overhead Analysis}
talk about the overhead the transparency mode introduces, + timing graphs

\subsection{Hypervisor Detection}
Deploy the transparency mode against public mainained tools that contain common hypervisor and debugging detection methods. Compare to bare metal, VMWare, VMWare+HyperDbg

\subsection{Comparison with ScyllaHide}
Compare the implemented system call hooking approach to ScyllaHide's usermode level interception

\subsection{Results}
General compilation of the results/achieved goals from the research proposal
