\section{Related Work}\label{s:related}

It is quite unlikely that you were the first to address this problem. Please use
this section, hence, to discuss what prior work had done and how your solution
is different from or better than prior work. You may place this section
immediately after the “Background” section, if necessary.

Srinivasan Keshav's old---but still relevant---article on how to read a paper
might be quite useful for also reviewing prior work~\cite{Keshav-SIGCOMMCCR2007}.
